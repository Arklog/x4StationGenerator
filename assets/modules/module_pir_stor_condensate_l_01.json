{"id":"module_pir_stor_condensate_l_01","version":1,"name":"Protectyon Shield Generator","macro":"storage_pir_l_condensate_01_macro","description":"The Protectyon Shield Generator was designed by the Northriver Company's Research and Development team. It is constructed in such a way that, when supplied with Protectyon condensate, it generates shielding that protects the entire station from the devastating effects of the Tide. As part of this process the Protectyon is depleted. Due to the high potency of Protectyon, and the incredible volatility inherent in such a substance, the module's design only allows for a small storage capacity.","type":"storage","explosionDamage":1000,"hull":1000000,"cargo":{"max":50},"price":{"min":1433988,"max":2146384,"avg":1790186},"owners":[{"id":"scavenger","version":1,"name":"Riptide Rakers","description":"The Riptide Rakers are a loose collective of miners, traders and scavengers, perpetually down on their luck and struggling to ensure their continued existence. Their way of life has been forged by the hostile environments of the Avarice system. Largely disorganised, and without any military capabilities, they do not pose a threat to any of the other inhabitants of the Jump Gate network; nor would they want to, since they are entirely focused on their own survival.nnBeing extremely resourceful, the Riptide Rakers have specialised in scrapping wrecked ships and other space debris commonly found in and around Avarice. Ingeniously making use of the exceptional stellar properties of Avarice, they are uniquely capable of maintaining an economy almost entirely focussed on recycling and reusing materials. Since they are generally on good terms with the other groups inhabiting the network, they have taken to dismantling wrecks and trading their recycled materials on a larger scale, ever since their gate re-established a connection.nnTheir resourcefulness and resilience is only matched by their stubbornness. Despite regularly suffering from the impact of the Tide, they stoically continue to live under the hazardous circumstances that make their large scale operations possible. In recent years they have found ways to shelter from the most devastating effects of the phenomenon, but stranded ships and the occasional station are still tragically annihilated. Many inhabitants of the network wonder why the Riptide Rakers would expose themselves to these dangers, but if you asked a Riptide Raker, the answer would be quite simple. They have become numb to the dangers of Avarice. It is their way of life, they will tell you, and they really just have nowhere else to go.","race":{"id":"argon","name":"Argon","description":"The descendents of Terran colonists stranded from Earth centuries ago, the Argon became their own thriving civilisation covering a great many systems and forging relations with several alien races. Throughout their short history the Argon Federation has been plagued by war, notably with the Xenon. Their greatest challenge however came from the unlikely source of the reconnected Terrans of Earth where they were plunged into the costly Terran Conflict.","icon":"race_argon"},"icon":"faction_scavenger","licenses":[{"type":"capitalequipment","name":"Rakers Capital Equipment Licence","icon":"bse_star","price":0},{"type":"capitalship","name":"Rakers Capital Ship Licence","icon":"bse_star","price":0},{"type":"ceremonyally","name":"Tide Breaker","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"ceremonyfriend","name":"Tide Runner","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"generaluseequipment","name":"Rakers General Use Equipment Licence","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"generaluseship","name":"Rakers General Use Ship Licence","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"militaryequipment","name":"Rakers Military Equipment Licence","icon":"bse_star","price":0},{"type":"militaryship","name":"Rakers Military Ship Licence","icon":"bse_star","price":0},{"type":"shipsalecontract","name":"Rakers Ship Sale Contract","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"station_equip_lxl","name":"Rakers Capital Ship Building Module Licence","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"station_equip_sm","name":"Rakers Ancillary Ship Building Module Licence","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"station_gen_advanced","name":"Rakers Advanced Module Licence","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"station_gen_basic","name":"Rakers Basic Module Licence","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"station_gen_intermediate","name":"Rakers Intermediate Module Licence","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"tradesubscription","name":"Rakers Trade Offer Subscription","icon":"","price":20000000}]}],"shields":[{"group":"column_02_l","size":"medium","hittable":true},{"group":"column_02_r","size":"medium","hittable":true},{"group":"column_03_r","size":"medium","hittable":true},{"group":"column_03_l","size":"medium","hittable":true},{"group":"column_01_l","size":"medium","hittable":true},{"group":"column_01_r","size":"medium","hittable":true}],"turrets":[{"group":"column_02_l","size":"medium","hittable":true,"types":["Standard","Missile"]},{"group":"column_02_l","size":"medium","hittable":true,"types":["Standard","Missile"]},{"group":"column_02_r","size":"medium","hittable":true,"types":["Standard","Missile"]},{"group":"column_02_r","size":"medium","hittable":true,"types":["Standard","Missile"]},{"group":"column_03_r","size":"medium","hittable":true,"types":["Standard","Missile"]},{"group":"column_03_r","size":"medium","hittable":true,"types":["Standard","Missile"]},{"group":"column_03_l","size":"medium","hittable":true,"types":["Standard","Missile"]},{"group":"column_03_l","size":"medium","hittable":true,"types":["Standard","Missile"]},{"group":"column_01_l","size":"medium","hittable":true,"types":["Standard","Missile"]},{"group":"column_01_l","size":"medium","hittable":true,"types":["Standard","Missile"]},{"group":"column_01_r","size":"medium","hittable":true,"types":["Standard","Missile"]},{"group":"column_01_r","size":"medium","hittable":true,"types":["Standard","Missile"]}],"production":[{"time":1033,"amount":1,"method":"default","name":"Closed Loop","wares":[{"ware":"claytronics","amount":291},{"ware":"energycells","amount":265},{"ware":"hullparts","amount":1198}]}]}
