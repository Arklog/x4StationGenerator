They quarrelled amongst themselves almost as much as they antagonised outsiders and the common citizens of Windfall. These smaller outfits mostly made money by offering security services to the large, wealthy gambling institutions, by running their own high-stakes games, and by manufacturing and trading illicit substances. The time spent in isolation was chaotic and violent, but the absence of any organised law enforcement also provided ample opportunities to get incredibly rich with comparatively little effort. Maintaining that wealth amid all the other cut-throats was the bigger challenge, and the reason why these smaller groups eventually banded together.nnThe Vigor Syndicate was not the only semi-organised criminal enterprise to arise out of this unstable but prolific environment, but ultimately it would be the one to assert itself. Its power and influence grew when contact with the people of Avarice was established. With no-one to oppose them, they soon began to exploit the Riptide Rakers by offering them predatory loans, and methodically nurturing industrial dependencies among their destitute neighbours.nnNow, although there still is no clearly identifiable leadership and back-stabbings are still a regular occurrence, the organisation has grown to such a size that it has stabilised and effectively presents a united front to the outside. With Windfall now connected to both Argon and Teladi space, the Syndicate has fully consolidated in order to project enough power to keep other organisations out of Windfall. They keep the law away, and offer unscrupulous entities the space in which to grow however they see fit; as long as the Vigor Syndicate gets their cut, of course.","race":{"id":"argon","name":"Argon","description":"The descendents of Terran colonists stranded from Earth centuries ago, the Argon became their own thriving civilisation covering a great many systems and forging relations with several alien races.

Their way of life has been forged by the hostile environments of the Avarice system. Largely disorganised, and without any military capabilities, they do not pose a threat to any of the other inhabitants of the Jump Gate network; nor would they want to, since they are entirely focused on their own survival.nnBeing extremely resourceful, the Riptide Rakers have specialised in scrapping wrecked ships and other space debris commonly found in and around Avarice. Ingeniously making use of the exceptional stellar properties of Avarice, they are uniquely capable of maintaining an economy almost entirely focussed on recycling and reusing materials. Since they are generally on good terms with the other groups inhabiting the network, they have taken to dismantling wrecks and trading their recycled materials on a larger scale, ever since their gate re-established a connection.nnTheir resourcefulness and resilience is only matched by their stubbornness. Despite regularly suffering from the impact of the Tide, they stoically continue to live under the hazardous circumstances that make their large scale operations possible. In recent years they have found ways to shelter from the most devastating effects of the phenomenon, but stranded ships and the occasional station are still tragically annihilated. Many inhabitants of the network wonder why the Riptide Rakers would expose themselves to these dangers, but if you asked a Riptide Raker, the answer would be quite simple. They have become numb to the dangers of Avarice. It is their way of life, they will tell you, and they really just have nowhere else to go.","race":{"id":"argon","name":"Argon","description":"The descendents of Terran colonists stranded from Earth centuries ago, the Argon became their own thriving civilisation covering a great many systems and forging relations with several alien races.
