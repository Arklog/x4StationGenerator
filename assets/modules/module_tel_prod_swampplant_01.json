Though it is widely known that swamp plant is the main ingredient of a drug made illegal throughout non-Teladi space, producing and trading it itself is not illegal, as it is only in the processing of the plant that the narcotic properties can be unlocked.","factoryName":"Swamp Plant Farm","icon":"ware_swampplant","volume":6,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":50,"max":117,"avg":84},"group":{"id":"agricultural","name":"Agricultural Goods","factoryName":"Agricultural Goods Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_agricultural","tier":5},"production":[{"time":450,"amount":120,"method":"default","name":"Teladi","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":40},{"ware":"water","amount":100}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.59}]}]}],"explosionDamage":1000,"hull":287000,"makerRace":{"id":"teladi","name":"Teladi","description":"The lizard-like Teladi are one of the founding members of the Community of Planets and have a natural affinity towards business and the accumulation of profit.

Everything they do is driven by their overriding imperative to turn a profit. They expand their reach in the hopes of coming across potential new trading partners and novel, exciting technologies they can sell. As the name implies, their organisation is structured like a company, with a CEO in the leadership position, surrounded by a board of directors. The Company's internal divisions are governed by Chairmen, who are given a lot of room to manoeuvre, as long as their policies increase the bottom line. As a result of this outlook, it is not uncommon for Chairmen to be in league with pirates and smugglers.","race":{"id":"teladi","name":"Teladi","description":"The lizard-like Teladi are one of the founding members of the Community of Planets and have a natural affinity towards business and the accumulation of profit.
