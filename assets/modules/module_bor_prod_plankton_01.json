It forms naturally where certain chemicals, that are found in the swamp, mix with the ammonia-based atmosphere.nnThis scum is collected, and then treated with additives and other Boron minerals, to produce a wide range of different, nutritious spices. Since the Boron seas are now completely protected from any industrial usage, Plankton is mainly produced in space, aboard huge Plankton Farms that can be found everywhere in the Queendom of Boron.","factoryName":"Plankton Farm","icon":"ware_plankton","volume":1,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":11,"max":25,"avg":18},"group":{"id":"agricultural","name":"Agricultural Goods","factoryName":"Agricultural Goods Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_agricultural","tier":5},"production":[{"time":400,"amount":275,"method":"default","name":"Boron","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":20},{"ware":"water","amount":50}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.4}]}]}],"explosionDamage":1000,"hull":135000,"makerRace":{"id":"boron","name":"Boron","description":"The predominantly peaceful Boron are aquatic life-forms from the planet Nishala.

Notoriously pacifist in nature, the Queendom perpetually works towards the greater good by advancing its knowledge of the sciences, and furthering inter-species understanding. Due to their innate trustworthiness, Queendom officials are often employed as peace-brokers by conflicting parties. However, it is also important to note that their inherently conflict-avoidant nature does not mean that they will fail to defend themselves when attacked. They boast an impressive arsenal of weapon technologies, afforded to them by their comparative wealth and scientific accomplishment.nnAs the name implies, the Queendom of Boron is headed by a queen, currently Queen Polypheides. Although Princess Celeus is the current heir, the succession is not strictly matrilineal. Non-royal Boron could theoretically ascend to the throne if they were to distinguish themselves through their actions and prove themselves to be the most capable leader. Counterintuitively, while the Queendom is reigned over by a monarch, it is still a democracy, overseen by a parliament of elected officials who vote on all policy and succession-related matters.","race":{"id":"boron","name":"Boron","description":"The predominantly peaceful Boron are aquatic life-forms from the planet Nishala.
