They quarrelled amongst themselves almost as much as they antagonised outsiders and the common citizens of Windfall. These smaller outfits mostly made money by offering security services to the large, wealthy gambling institutions, by running their own high-stakes games, and by manufacturing and trading illicit substances. The time spent in isolation was chaotic and violent, but the absence of any organised law enforcement also provided ample opportunities to get incredibly rich with comparatively little effort. Maintaining that wealth amid all the other cut-throats was the bigger challenge, and the reason why these smaller groups eventually banded together.nnThe Vigor Syndicate was not the only semi-organised criminal enterprise to arise out of this unstable but prolific environment, but ultimately it would be the one to assert itself. Its power and influence grew when contact with the people of Avarice was established. With no-one to oppose them, they soon began to exploit the Riptide Rakers by offering them predatory loans, and methodically nurturing industrial dependencies among their destitute neighbours.nnNow, although there still is no clearly identifiable leadership and back-stabbings are still a regular occurrence, the organisation has grown to such a size that it has stabilised and effectively presents a united front to the outside. With Windfall now connected to both Argon and Teladi space, the Syndicate has fully consolidated in order to project enough power to keep other organisations out of Windfall. They keep the law away, and offer unscrupulous entities the space in which to grow however they see fit; as long as the Vigor Syndicate gets their cut, of course.","race":{"id":"argon","name":"Argon","description":"The descendents of Terran colonists stranded from Earth centuries ago, the Argon became their own thriving civilisation covering a great many systems and forging relations with several alien races.

While the Antigone Republic is a distinct entity detached from the Argon Federation, and they are wary of returning back into the Federation, they maintain close ties, and cooperate on many levels. Sandwell, for example, is a planet of the Antigone Memorial system, which hosts the Argon Federation's biggest data archive. The Antigone Republic and the Argon Federation frequently conduct joint military operations to beat back Xenon invasions, and they trade freely and often.","race":{"id":"argon","name":"Argon","description":"The descendents of Terran colonists stranded from Earth centuries ago, the Argon became their own thriving civilisation covering a great many systems and forging relations with several alien races.
