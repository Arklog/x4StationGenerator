{"id":"module_gen_proc_scrapworks","version":0,"name":"Scrap Processor","macro":"proc_gen_scrapworks_macro","description":"The Jump Gate shutdown left Avarice with very limited access to resources, so stranded Argon engineers started development of various recycling facilities. One of these was the Scrap Processor; a module that takes in S- and M-sized ship wrecks to process the contained Raw Scrap into Scrap Metal, which can, in turn, be recycled into other useable resources. The first Tug ships were also developed at this time, to transport the wrecks to the Scrap Processor. Scrap Cubes were a later introduction, designed to allow larger wrecks to be packed up into blocks suitable for towing and processing.nnFollowing the arrival of messenger drones from Sacred Relic, the people of Avarice sent out drones of their own to other disconnected systems. These drones contained blueprints for their recycling technology, in the hopes that it would be of help to others who were unfortunate enough to be stranded with no natural resources to hand. In the process, they created a local branch of the Alliance of the Word, operating out of Tidebreak. With the first Jump Gate reconnection in 825 (NT), the Alliance of the Word moved to its own station in Windfall.","explosionDamage":1000,"hull":150000,"price":{"min":992413,"max":1342677,"avg":1167545},"owners":[{"id":"alliance","version":0,"name":"Alliance of the Word","description":"As the universe cascaded into chaos during the first years of the Jump Gate shutdown, a new faction emerged, made up of scholars, scientists, and historians.

These attempts, unfortunately, bore little in the way of fruit. They could not avert the shutdown, but they did set out to re-establish contact with the disparate systems by sending out durable drones that could withstand the arduous journeys.nnAfter the Gates resumed function, their focus shifted to mapping out the network's changed layout and exploring newly discovered systems. However, they have not given up on the idea of getting to grips with Jump Gate technology and work out contingency plans, as a future shutdown cannot be entirely ruled out.","race":{"id":"paranid","name":"Paranid","description":"The physically imposing Paranid are often regarded as arrogant by several races which usually stems from their exceptional mathematic skills and religious fervour.

With the stated aim of exploring and settling the furthest outskirts of Sol, they then rallied the displaced groups under its banner.
