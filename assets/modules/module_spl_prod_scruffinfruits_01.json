They are grown by Split farmers in large, open fields on a number of planets, as well as in space aboard large installations known as Scruffin Farms. Scruffin flesh is a versatile foodstuff that, when processed, provides the basis of a number of Split food types. Although Scruffin are traded both inside and outside Split territory, they are mainly in demand in areas where Split workers are in abundance.","factoryName":"Scruffin Farm","icon":"ware_scruffinfruit","volume":6,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":17,"max":40,"avg":28},"group":{"id":"agricultural","name":"Agricultural Goods","factoryName":"Agricultural Goods Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_agricultural","tier":5},"production":[{"time":300,"amount":255,"method":"default","name":"Split","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":30},{"ware":"water","amount":80}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.53}]}]}],"explosionDamage":1000,"hull":280000,"makerRace":{"id":"split","name":"Split","description":"The aggressive Split live in a society constantly changing leadership where challenging factions rise up to impose a new Patriarch.

When the systems disconnected, the smaller families rebelled against the Patriarch of all Split and fought an intense war for independence. They persevered and managed to establish a different kind of Split society in their systems, one that is not lorded over by one Patriarch. Instead, every family is governed autonomously by their own Patriarchs. Now that the Jump Gates have reconnected, this new way of governance is opposed by the Patriarchy. After the Fires  the patriarchal empire seeks to unite the Split under a single family once again.","race":{"id":"split","name":"Split","description":"The aggressive Split live in a society constantly changing leadership where challenging factions rise up to impose a new Patriarch.

He served under Patriarch Rhonkar before the Gates shut down, but due to his system's close proximity to Xenon space, he learned how to be self-sufficient. This familiarity with self-reliance would become his biggest asset when, as the larger Split empire was disconnected, he rose to power, unifying the neighbouring Patriarchs under him. When the Gates reconnected, the Zyarth Patriarchy emerged as the clear victor. Many long-established Patriarchs had died during those tumultuous times. While many families in close proximity came together under the Zyarth, other families seized the same opportunity to declare their independence from the former Patriarch Rhonkar. Now the ambitious Zyarth seeks to unify all Split, even the Free Families, under his banner.","race":{"id":"split","name":"Split","description":"The aggressive Split live in a society constantly changing leadership where challenging factions rise up to impose a new Patriarch.
