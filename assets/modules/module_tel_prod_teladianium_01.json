A lighter compound than the refined metals used in other races' vessels, Teladianium is traditionally made from chemically treated Teladian mud. However, as the necessary chemicals are rarely found in space, and expensive to produce, the Teladi often replace them with the raw minerals found in asteroids.","factoryName":"Teladianium Foundry","icon":"ware_teladianium","volume":16,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":121,"max":283,"avg":202},"group":{"id":"refined","name":"Refined Goods","factoryName":"Refined Goods Complex","icon":"be_upgrade_refined","tier":2},"production":[{"time":120,"amount":70,"method":"default","name":"Teladi","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":45},{"ware":"ore","amount":280}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.43}]}]}],"explosionDamage":1000,"hull":226000,"makerRace":{"id":"teladi","name":"Teladi","description":"The lizard-like Teladi are one of the founding members of the Community of Planets and have a natural affinity towards business and the accumulation of profit.

Everything they do is driven by their overriding imperative to turn a profit. They expand their reach in the hopes of coming across potential new trading partners and novel, exciting technologies they can sell. As the name implies, their organisation is structured like a company, with a CEO in the leadership position, surrounded by a board of directors. The Company's internal divisions are governed by Chairmen, who are given a lot of room to manoeuvre, as long as their policies increase the bottom line. As a result of this outlook, it is not uncommon for Chairmen to be in league with pirates and smugglers.","race":{"id":"teladi","name":"Teladi","description":"The lizard-like Teladi are one of the founding members of the Community of Planets and have a natural affinity towards business and the accumulation of profit.
