Through its inception, the unthinkable geometric paradox of the two Pontifices has been remedied, and thus the Paranid Civil War officially brought to an end. Though there were numerous attempts to sabotage the negotiations, including a heinous attack on the construction site of the anonymously funded Sacrosanct Conclave, unity was ultimately achieved and defended by a most holy alliance of benefactors and proponents of peace. The political goals of the Trinity of Pontifices remain yet unknown, though it is universally expected that they will use their newly gained power to shift the political climate of the network towards peaceful coexistence.nnHistorical record: Godrealm of the ParanidnThe Godrealm of the Paranid is a theocratic feudal society worshipping the concept of the three-dimensionality.
