The Teladi race is quite cautious by nature. To turn a Teladi pilot into an efficient Ministry of Finance fighter, their natural instinct to avoid conflict has to be overcome in an arduous, and sometimes brutal, training regime.nnWhile their main purpose used to be to support the Teladi Company's expansionist efforts and keep internal corruption at bay, their attention has more recently shifted towards protecting the Teladi from external threats. The resurgence of Xenon activity at the borders of Teladi space keeps a large part of their forces occupied. Those who are not busy fighting off the Xenon, patrol Teladi territory for pirate activity. Scale Plate pirates may be tolerated as a minor nuisance by most in the Teladi Company, and may even be tentatively looked toward as business partners by the more unscrupulous elements within the Company, but the Ministry of Finance has no tolerance at all for their lawlessness.","race":{"id":"teladi","name":"Teladi","description":"The lizard-like Teladi are one of the founding members of the Community of Planets and have a natural affinity towards business and the accumulation of profit.
