He served under Patriarch Rhonkar before the Gates shut down, but due to his system's close proximity to Xenon space, he learned how to be self-sufficient. This familiarity with self-reliance would become his biggest asset when, as the larger Split empire was disconnected, he rose to power, unifying the neighbouring Patriarchs under him. When the Gates reconnected, the Zyarth Patriarchy emerged as the clear victor. Many long-established Patriarchs had died during those tumultuous times. While many families in close proximity came together under the Zyarth, other families seized the same opportunity to declare their independence from the former Patriarch Rhonkar. Now the ambitious Zyarth seeks to unify all Split, even the Free Families, under his banner.","race":{"id":"split","name":"Split","description":"The aggressive Split live in a society constantly changing leadership where challenging factions rise up to impose a new Patriarch.
