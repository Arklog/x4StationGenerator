Their Pontifex is shrouded in mystery and defends this radical new interpretation of the Paranid faith with a zealous frenzy. The Holy Order is steadfast in their beliefs, which puts them at odds with the Godrealm of the Paranid. They do not wish to eradicate the Godrealm, but to convert them to their beliefs. Their fanatic attitude is less accommodating towards non-Paranid heretics.","race":{"id":"paranid","name":"Paranid","description":"The physically imposing Paranid are often regarded as arrogant by several races which usually stems from their exceptional mathematic skills and religious fervour.

They refer to their ancient holy texts to justify their archaic power structure and pervasive authority. Although this Godrealm has been cut off from Paranid Prime, they understand themselves to be the true purveyors of the Paranid faith. After the Gates realigned, their strict interpretation of this faith resulted in tensions with the Holy Order of the Pontifex, and eventually, a civil war broke out. Still, the Godrealm maintains that the ultimate goal is not to exterminate the Paranids fighting for Holy Order, but to welcome them back into the fold.","race":{"id":"paranid","name":"Paranid","description":"The physically imposing Paranid are often regarded as arrogant by several races which usually stems from their exceptional mathematic skills and religious fervour.

After some political back-and-forth, they were officially recognised by the Argon Federation, but because they were perceived as naive by some elements of the Federation's government, the Hatikvah Free League was kept somewhat at arm's length. As a result of their inherent openness and their penchant for dealing in extra-legal wares, they soon attracted criminals and disenfranchised people seeking safe haven. When the Jump Gates shut down and their situation grew more desperate, the organisation shifted even further towards piracy, and began working with the Scale Plate Pact.nnMore recently, the Hatikvah Free League has shown a desire to re-align themselves more closely with the Argon Federation, and shift their focus towards more legitimate business in an attempt to rebuild and mend relations.","race":{"id":"argon","name":"Argon","description":"The descendents of Terran colonists stranded from Earth centuries ago, the Argon became their own thriving civilisation covering a great many systems and forging relations with several alien races.
