While naturally engine parts are a very necessary resource across the entire Jump Gate network, the ability to produce and repair engines on demand, instead of requiring an entirely separate production step for each, has greatly streamlined the universal economy.","factoryName":"Engine Part Factory","icon":"ware_engineparts","volume":15,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":128,"max":237,"avg":182},"group":{"id":"hightech","name":"High Tech Goods","factoryName":"High Tech Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_hightech","tier":3},"production":[{"time":900,"amount":208,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"antimattercells","amount":80},{"ware":"energycells","amount":60},{"ware":"refinedmetals","amount":96}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.47}]},{"time":900,"amount":208,"method":"teladi","name":"Teladi","wares":[{"ware":"antimattercells","amount":80},{"ware":"energycells","amount":60},{"ware":"teladianium","amount":70}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.47}]}]}],"explosionDamage":1000,"hull":120000,"makerRace":{"id":"teladi","name":"Teladi","description":"The lizard-like Teladi are one of the founding members of the Community of Planets and have a natural affinity towards business and the accumulation of profit.

Everything they do is driven by their overriding imperative to turn a profit. They expand their reach in the hopes of coming across potential new trading partners and novel, exciting technologies they can sell. As the name implies, their organisation is structured like a company, with a CEO in the leadership position, surrounded by a board of directors. The Company's internal divisions are governed by Chairmen, who are given a lot of room to manoeuvre, as long as their policies increase the bottom line. As a result of this outlook, it is not uncommon for Chairmen to be in league with pirates and smugglers.","race":{"id":"teladi","name":"Teladi","description":"The lizard-like Teladi are one of the founding members of the Community of Planets and have a natural affinity towards business and the accumulation of profit.
