The Scrap Recycler was designed to process Scrap Metal into usable resources, converting it into Hull Parts and Claytronics in alternating production cycles.nnFollowing the arrival of messenger drones from Sacred Relic, the people of Avarice sent out drones of their own to other disconnected systems. These drones contained blueprints for their recycling technology, in the hopes that it would be of help to others who were unfortunate enough to be stranded with no natural resources to hand. In the process, they created a local branch of the Alliance of the Word, operating out of Tidebreak. With the first Jump Gate reconnection in 825 (NT), the Alliance of the Word moved to its own station in Windfall.","type":"production","product":[{"id":"claytronics","version":0,"name":"Claytronics","description":"More commonly known as programmable matter, claytronics are made up of millions of individual nanometre-scale computers known as catoms.

Claytronics are always in high-demand, as the universe rebuilds itself after the Jump Gate shutdown.","factoryName":"Claytronics Factory","icon":"ware_claytronics","volume":24,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":1734,"max":2346,"avg":2040},"group":{"id":"shiptech","name":"Ship Technology","factoryName":"Ship Technology Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_shiptech","tier":4},"production":[{"time":900,"amount":108,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"antimattercells","amount":100},{"ware":"energycells","amount":140},{"ware":"microchips","amount":160},{"ware":"quantumtubes","amount":100}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.34}]},{"time":300,"amount":60,"method":"recycling","name":"Recycling","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":12000},{"ware":"scrapmetal","amount":300}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.34}]}]},{"id":"hullparts","version":0,"name":"Hull Parts","description":"Made from refined metals or teladianium, Hull Parts are most commonly used to build the hulls of ships and stations, though they do have some other uses such as in drones and weapons.

They could not avert the shutdown, but they did set out to re-establish contact with the disparate systems by sending out durable drones that could withstand the arduous journeys.nnAfter the Gates resumed function, their focus shifted to mapping out the network's changed layout and exploring newly discovered systems.

Ingeniously making use of the exceptional stellar properties of Avarice, they are uniquely capable of maintaining an economy almost entirely focussed on recycling and reusing materials.

In recent years they have found ways to shelter from the most devastating effects of the phenomenon, but stranded ships and the occasional station are still tragically annihilated. Many inhabitants of the network wonder why the Riptide Rakers would expose themselves to these dangers, but if you asked a Riptide Raker, the answer would be quite simple.
