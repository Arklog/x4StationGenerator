Usually layered for additional protection, and using other compounds to further reinforce, Hull Parts are still cheap to produce - a bonus, considering their position as the most frequently used resource in the Jump Gate network.","factoryName":"Hull Part Factory","icon":"ware_hullparts","volume":12,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":146,"max":272,"avg":209},"group":{"id":"hightech","name":"High Tech Goods","factoryName":"High Tech Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_hightech","tier":3},"production":[{"time":900,"amount":294,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":80},{"ware":"graphene","amount":40},{"ware":"refinedmetals","amount":280}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.37}]},{"time":300,"amount":200,"method":"recycling","name":"Recycling","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":3500},{"ware":"scrapmetal","amount":75}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.37}]},{"time":900,"amount":294,"method":"teladi","name":"Teladi","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":80},{"ware":"graphene","amount":40},{"ware":"teladianium","amount":204}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.37}]}]}],"explosionDamage":1000,"hull":146000,"makerRace":{"id":"teladi","name":"Teladi","description":"The lizard-like Teladi are one of the founding members of the Community of Planets and have a natural affinity towards business and the accumulation of profit.

Everything they do is driven by their overriding imperative to turn a profit. They expand their reach in the hopes of coming across potential new trading partners and novel, exciting technologies they can sell. As the name implies, their organisation is structured like a company, with a CEO in the leadership position, surrounded by a board of directors. The Company's internal divisions are governed by Chairmen, who are given a lot of room to manoeuvre, as long as their policies increase the bottom line. As a result of this outlook, it is not uncommon for Chairmen to be in league with pirates and smugglers.","race":{"id":"teladi","name":"Teladi","description":"The lizard-like Teladi are one of the founding members of the Community of Planets and have a natural affinity towards business and the accumulation of profit.
