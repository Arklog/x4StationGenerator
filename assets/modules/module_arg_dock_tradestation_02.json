The fledgling republic was named after the system in which it resides, the system itself paying tribute to the Argon station whose loss is recorded in history as one of the greatest horrors of the Xenon wars. While the Antigone Republic is a distinct entity detached from the Argon Federation, and they are wary of returning back into the Federation, they maintain close ties, and cooperate on many levels. Sandwell, for example, is a planet of the Antigone Memorial system, which hosts the Argon Federation's biggest data archive. The Antigone Republic and the Argon Federation frequently conduct joint military operations to beat back Xenon invasions, and they trade freely and often.","race":{"id":"argon","name":"Argon","description":"The descendents of Terran colonists stranded from Earth centuries ago, the Argon became their own thriving civilisation covering a great many systems and forging relations with several alien races. Throughout their short history the Argon Federation has been plagued by war, notably with the Xenon.
