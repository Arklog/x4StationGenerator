{"id":"module_ter_prod_scrap_recycler","version":1,"name":"Terran Scrap Recycler","macro":"prod_ter_scrap_recycler_macro","description":"The Jump Gate shutdown left Avarice with very limited access to resources, so stranded Argon engineers started development of various recycling facilities. The Scrap Recycler was designed to process Scrap Metal into usable resources, converting it into Hull Parts and Claytronics in alternating production cycles.nnFollowing the arrival of messenger drones from Sacred Relic, the people of Avarice sent out drones of their own to other disconnected systems. These drones contained blueprints for their recycling technology, in the hopes that it would be of help to others who were unfortunate enough to be stranded with no natural resources to hand. In the process, they created a local branch of the Alliance of the Word, operating out of Tidebreak. With the first Jump Gate reconnection in 825 (NT), the Alliance of the Word moved to its own station in Windfall.nnUpon receiving blueprints for the Scrap Recycler, the Segaris Pioneers modified them to be compatible with their Terran economy. Instead of converting Scrap Metal to Hull Parts and Claytronics, their variant produced Silicon Carbide and Computronic Substrate in the same alternating fashion.","type":"production","product":[{"id":"computronicsubstrate","version":1,"name":"Computronic Substrate","description":"Computronic Substrate is the advanced Terran version of programmable matter.

The Terran government was wary of these refugee communities suddenly forming in their midst. In order to keep them away from Sol's inner core, and make the best of a difficult situation, the Terran government brought the Pioneer Initiative into being. With the stated aim of exploring and settling the furthest outskirts of Sol, they then rallied the displaced groups under its banner. When a Gate connection was restored, and Neptune was suddenly adjacent to several unclaimed systems, the Terran government encouraged the Pioneer Initiative to venture out of Sol and explore and settle this new-found space.nnDelighted to now have a home of their own, the Pioneer Initiative, upon re-discovering the Segaris system, welcomed more and more disparate groups into their fold and distanced themselves from their Terran origin by changing their name to Segaris Pioneers. Their effort to gain true independence is a work in progress, however. It is a delicate balancing act, as they are still heavily reliant on the Terran government for protection and economic support. Their hope and belief is that the best way out of this disadvantageous situation, is to throw themselves into seeking scientific advancements that can one day lead to them to true independence.","race":{"id":"terran","name":"Terran","description":"The Terrans of the Solar System have a long history of spaceflight and exploring the Jump Gate network.
