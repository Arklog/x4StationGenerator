The fledgling republic was named after the system in which it resides, the system itself paying tribute to the Argon station whose loss is recorded in history as one of the greatest horrors of the Xenon wars. While the Antigone Republic is a distinct entity detached from the Argon Federation, and they are wary of returning back into the Federation, they maintain close ties, and cooperate on many levels. Sandwell, for example, is a planet of the Antigone Memorial system, which hosts the Argon Federation's biggest data archive. The Antigone Republic and the Argon Federation frequently conduct joint military operations to beat back Xenon invasions, and they trade freely and often.","race":{"id":"argon","name":"Argon","description":"The descendents of Terran colonists stranded from Earth centuries ago, the Argon became their own thriving civilisation covering a great many systems and forging relations with several alien races.

The restructuring of these responsibilities came about following the USC's failure to prevent the destruction of the Torus Aeternal by foreign saboteurs; an incident which scarred the Terran population and threw the government's ability to protect Sol into question.nnDuring the Jump Gate shutdown, the Terran government seized the opportunity to reassure their citizens. Separated from the network, their economy thrived and the Terran Protectorate fortified their presence in Sol. Critics of the Terran government have claimed that establishing the Protectorate was merely an attempt to re-brand the USC, and that the underlying structural problems remained. However, there is no disputing that the Terran Protectorate does now operate differently from its predecessors. Not only is the Protectorate extremely zealous in its defence of the inner core of Sol, to the point where not even all Terran citizens are allowed to approach Earth, but they are also heavily involved in Sol's external relations. Frustrated with how the Commonwealth has, in their eyes, mishandled the Xenon, they have taken a much more proactive approach to engaging the Xenon across the network. Fleets are regularly sent out to ensure that Xenon pockets are eradicated, without regard for the sovereignty of the space in question. Nor do they shy away from actively trying to meddle in other governments' affairs in order to influence their stance on AGI technology. Their preoccupation with destroying the Xenon at all costs frequently puts them at odds with the Community of Planets.","race":{"id":"terran","name":"Terran","description":"The Terrans of the Solar System have a long history of spaceflight and exploring the Jump Gate network.
