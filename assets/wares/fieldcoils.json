{"id":"fieldcoils","version":0,"name":"Field Coils","description":"Used to fine-tune the arrays used on ship and station shielding, field coils allow for much more modulation than using shield components alone. As such shipyards have begun using them to build a much wider variety of shields than was previously available. Like many of the components used on ships - that aren't the hull itself - shield components are shipped straight to shipyards and equipment docks so that shields can be produced on-demand.","factoryName":"Field Coil Factory","icon":"ware_fieldcoils","volume":15,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":247,"max":576,"avg":412},"group":{"id":"shiptech","name":"Ship Technology","factoryName":"Ship Technology Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_shiptech","tier":4},"production":[{"time":600,"amount":175,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":60},{"ware":"plasmaconductors","amount":40},{"ware":"quantumtubes","amount":43}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.43}]}]}
