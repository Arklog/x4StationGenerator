{"id":"microchips","version":0,"name":"Microchips","description":"Used in a wide variety of equipment parts, micro-chips are produced using silicon wafers, which, while fragile, allows them to conduct at a much higher rate. This, in turn, allows far better processing in the equipment that uses the micro-chips, which includes many advanced electronics and components.","factoryName":"Microchip Factory","icon":"ware_microchips","volume":22,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":805,"max":1090,"avg":948},"group":{"id":"hightech","name":"High Tech Goods","factoryName":"High Tech Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_hightech","tier":3},"production":[{"time":600,"amount":72,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":50},{"ware":"siliconwafers","amount":200}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.36}]}]}
