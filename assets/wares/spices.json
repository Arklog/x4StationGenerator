{"id":"spices","version":0,"name":"Spices","description":"Spices are used in many food and pharmaceutical products; primarily as an agent to add extra flavour, but also sometimes due to other properties that some are known to have, ranging from acting as a relaxant to a mild hallucinogenic. Factories that legally produce spices are commonly inspected to make sure their produce is in line with the local law, but as they are often shipped as a mixture, it is sometimes difficult to keep an eye on which spice is being used for which purpose.","factoryName":"Spice Farm","icon":"ware_spices","volume":3,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":12,"max":28,"avg":20},"group":{"id":"agricultural","name":"Agricultural Goods","factoryName":"Agricultural Goods Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_agricultural","tier":5},"production":[{"time":600,"amount":500,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":40},{"ware":"water","amount":80}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.4}]}]}
