{"id":"claytronics","version":0,"name":"Claytronics","description":"More commonly known as programmable matter, claytronics are made up of millions of individual nanometre-scale computers known as catoms. This technology lives at the heart of any non-Xenon station, used to build anything from internal wiring to computer systems and control mechanisms - effectively everything but the hull of the station itself. Claytronics are always in high-demand, as the universe rebuilds itself after the Jump Gate shutdown.","factoryName":"Claytronics Factory","icon":"ware_claytronics","volume":24,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":1734,"max":2346,"avg":2040},"group":{"id":"shiptech","name":"Ship Technology","factoryName":"Ship Technology Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_shiptech","tier":4},"production":[{"time":900,"amount":108,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"antimattercells","amount":100},{"ware":"energycells","amount":140},{"ware":"microchips","amount":160},{"ware":"quantumtubes","amount":100}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.34}]},{"time":300,"amount":60,"method":"recycling","name":"Recycling","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":12000},{"ware":"scrapmetal","amount":300}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.34}]}]}
