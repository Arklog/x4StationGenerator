{"id":"water","version":0,"name":"Water","description":"Essential to all known biological life forms, water has never become much of a catalyst for dispute amongst species, owing to its ubiquity in space. It is being used somewhere in the manufacturing process of nearly all goods available across space; especially, however, in the production of edible goods.","factoryName":"Ice Refinery","icon":"ware_water","volume":6,"transport":"Container","illegal":[{"id":"loanshark","version":1,"name":"Vigor Syndicate","description":"Before the Windfall system became connected to Avarice, and later the network at large, the Vigor Syndicate used to be made up of smaller criminal organisations. They quarrelled amongst themselves almost as much as they antagonised outsiders and the common citizens of Windfall. These smaller outfits mostly made money by offering security services to the large, wealthy gambling institutions, by running their own high-stakes games, and by manufacturing and trading illicit substances. The time spent in isolation was chaotic and violent, but the absence of any organised law enforcement also provided ample opportunities to get incredibly rich with comparatively little effort. Maintaining that wealth amid all the other cut-throats was the bigger challenge, and the reason why these smaller groups eventually banded together.nnThe Vigor Syndicate was not the only semi-organised criminal enterprise to arise out of this unstable but prolific environment, but ultimately it would be the one to assert itself. Its power and influence grew when contact with the people of Avarice was established. With no-one to oppose them, they soon began to exploit the Riptide Rakers by offering them predatory loans, and methodically nurturing industrial dependencies among their destitute neighbours.nnNow, although there still is no clearly identifiable leadership and back-stabbings are still a regular occurrence, the organisation has grown to such a size that it has stabilised and effectively presents a united front to the outside. With Windfall now connected to both Argon and Teladi space, the Syndicate has fully consolidated in order to project enough power to keep other organisations out of Windfall. They keep the law away, and offer unscrupulous entities the space in which to grow however they see fit; as long as the Vigor Syndicate gets their cut, of course.","race":{"id":"argon","name":"Argon","description":"The descendents of Terran colonists stranded from Earth centuries ago, the Argon became their own thriving civilisation covering a great many systems and forging relations with several alien races. Throughout their short history the Argon Federation has been plagued by war, notably with the Xenon. Their greatest challenge however came from the unlikely source of the reconnected Terrans of Earth where they were plunged into the costly Terran Conflict.","icon":"race_argon"},"icon":"faction_loanshark","licenses":[{"type":"capitalequipment","name":"Syndicate Capital Equipment Licence","icon":"bse_star","price":0},{"type":"capitalship","name":"Syndicate Capital Ship Licence","icon":"bse_star","price":0},{"type":"ceremonyally","name":"Capo","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"ceremonyfriend","name":"Syndicate Enforcer","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"generaluseequipment","name":"Syndicate General Use Equipment Licence","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"generaluseship","name":"Syndicate General Use Ship Licence","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"militaryequipment","name":"Syndicate Military Equipment Licence","icon":"bse_star","price":0},{"type":"militaryship","name":"Syndicate Military Ship Licence","icon":"bse_star","price":0},{"type":"police","name":"Syndicate Police Licence","icon":"","price":512000},{"type":"shipsalecontract","name":"Syndicate Ship Sale Contract","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"station_equip_lxl","name":"Syndicate Capital Ship Building Module Licence","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"station_equip_sm","name":"Syndicate Ancillary Ship Building Module Licence","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"station_gen_advanced","name":"Syndicate Advanced Module Licence","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"station_gen_basic","name":"Syndicate Basic Module Licence","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"station_gen_intermediate","name":"Syndicate Intermediate Module Licence","icon":"","price":0},{"type":"tradesubscription","name":"Syndicate Trade Offer Subscription","icon":"","price":20000000}]}],"price":{"min":32,"max":74,"avg":53},"group":{"id":"water","name":"Water","factoryName":"Water Refinery","icon":"be_upgrade_water","tier":2},"production":[{"time":120,"amount":193,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":60},{"ware":"ice","amount":320}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.43}]}]}
