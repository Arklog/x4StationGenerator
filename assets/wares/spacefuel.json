While the Antigone Republic is a distinct entity detached from the Argon Federation, and they are wary of returning back into the Federation, they maintain close ties, and cooperate on many levels. Sandwell, for example, is a planet of the Antigone Memorial system, which hosts the Argon Federation's biggest data archive.

The Terran government was wary of these refugee communities suddenly forming in their midst. In order to keep them away from Sol's inner core, and make the best of a difficult situation, the Terran government brought the Pioneer Initiative into being. With the stated aim of exploring and settling the furthest outskirts of Sol, they then rallied the displaced groups under its banner. When a Gate connection was restored, and Neptune was suddenly adjacent to several unclaimed systems, the Terran government encouraged the Pioneer Initiative to venture out of Sol and explore and settle this new-found space.nnDelighted to now have a home of their own, the Pioneer Initiative, upon re-discovering the Segaris system, welcomed more and more disparate groups into their fold and distanced themselves from their Terran origin by changing their name to Segaris Pioneers. Their effort to gain true independence is a work in progress, however. It is a delicate balancing act, as they are still heavily reliant on the Terran government for protection and economic support. Their hope and belief is that the best way out of this disadvantageous situation, is to throw themselves into seeking scientific advancements that can one day lead to them to true independence.","race":{"id":"terran","name":"Terran","description":"The Terrans of the Solar System have a long history of spaceflight and exploring the Jump Gate network.

The restructuring of these responsibilities came about following the USC's failure to prevent the destruction of the Torus Aeternal by foreign saboteurs; an incident which scarred the Terran population and threw the government's ability to protect Sol into question.nnDuring the Jump Gate shutdown, the Terran government seized the opportunity to reassure their citizens. Separated from the network, their economy thrived and the Terran Protectorate fortified their presence in Sol. Critics of the Terran government have claimed that establishing the Protectorate was merely an attempt to re-brand the USC, and that the underlying structural problems remained. However, there is no disputing that the Terran Protectorate does now operate differently from its predecessors. Not only is the Protectorate extremely zealous in its defence of the inner core of Sol, to the point where not even all Terran citizens are allowed to approach Earth, but they are also heavily involved in Sol's external relations. Frustrated with how the Commonwealth has, in their eyes, mishandled the Xenon, they have taken a much more proactive approach to engaging the Xenon across the network. Fleets are regularly sent out to ensure that Xenon pockets are eradicated, without regard for the sovereignty of the space in question. Nor do they shy away from actively trying to meddle in other governments' affairs in order to influence their stance on AGI technology. Their preoccupation with destroying the Xenon at all costs frequently puts them at odds with the Community of Planets.","race":{"id":"terran","name":"Terran","description":"The Terrans of the Solar System have a long history of spaceflight and exploring the Jump Gate network.
