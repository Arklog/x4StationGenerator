{"id":"advancedelectronics","version":0,"name":"Advanced Electronics","description":"Designed specifically to work alongside weapon and turret components, it is a variety of advanced electronics that allow different weapons and turrets to have a range of turning speeds, fire rates and cooldowns. Whereas field coils for shields and antimatter converters for engines are more modular and can be used 'across the board', different weapons and turrets expect different electronic systems to be used in order to ensure the correct properties. However, as all equipment is built and repaired on demand, all advanced electronics are shipped to shipyards and equipment docks together.","factoryName":"Advanced Electronics Factory","icon":"ware_advancedelectronics","volume":30,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":710,"max":1318,"avg":1014},"group":{"id":"shiptech","name":"Ship Technology","factoryName":"Ship Technology Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_shiptech","tier":4},"production":[{"time":720,"amount":54,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":60},{"ware":"microchips","amount":44},{"ware":"quantumtubes","amount":20}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.36}]}]}
