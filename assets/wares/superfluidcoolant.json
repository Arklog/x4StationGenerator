{"id":"superfluidcoolant","version":0,"name":"Superfluid Coolant","description":"Designed with superfluidity to ensure both efficiency and endurance, this coolant is used in complex technical components such as plasma conductors and quantum tubes to protect said components from overheating. The losslessness of kinetic energy afforded by the coolant's superfluidity means that it can continue to circulate around the component for a much longer time before needing to be recycled. This has led to such components lifetimes being greatly increased.","factoryName":"Helium Refinery","icon":"ware_superfluidcoolant","volume":16,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":90,"max":211,"avg":150},"group":{"id":"refined","name":"Refined Goods","factoryName":"Refined Goods Complex","icon":"be_upgrade_refined","tier":2},"production":[{"time":240,"amount":95,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":60},{"ware":"helium","amount":320}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.49}]}]}
