{"id":"weaponcomponents","version":0,"name":"Weapon Components","description":"Made up from such things as trigger and reloading mechanisms, chambers and barrels, weapon components make up the mechanical part of all ship weapons. Combined with specialised advanced electronics, a number of different weapons can be made from the modular components, also across different size ranges. Shipped to shipyards and equipment docks as a single package, these components can then be put together relatively quickly and easily to make any weapon for the final customer on-demand.","factoryName":"Weapon Component Factory","icon":"ware_weaponcomponents","volume":20,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":171,"max":399,"avg":285},"group":{"id":"shiptech","name":"Ship Technology","factoryName":"Ship Technology Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_shiptech","tier":4},"production":[{"time":1800,"amount":170,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":60},{"ware":"hullparts","amount":20},{"ware":"plasmaconductors","amount":30}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.53}]}]}
