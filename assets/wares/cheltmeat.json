{"id":"cheltmeat","version":1,"name":"Chelt Meat","description":"Chelts are sea-bound creatures that once roamed the seas and oceans of the Split home planet. The Split harvested them for meat, oil and their skins, which they used to create a tough leather like material. However, Chelts were eventually over-hunted and almost brought to extinction. Nowadays Chelts are grown in space, in Chelt Aquariums, and used to produce food for Split workers to consume.","factoryName":"Chelt Aquarium","icon":"ware_cheltmeat","volume":7,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":31,"max":72,"avg":51},"group":{"id":"agricultural","name":"Agricultural Goods","factoryName":"Agricultural Goods Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_agricultural","tier":5},"production":[{"time":450,"amount":209,"method":"default","name":"Split","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":50},{"ware":"water","amount":120}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.6}]}]}
