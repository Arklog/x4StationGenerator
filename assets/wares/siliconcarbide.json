{"id":"siliconcarbide","version":1,"name":"Silicon Carbide","description":"Silicon Carbide is a semiconductor containing silicon and carbon. It can be used to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance. Its electrical properties make the material suitable for dealing with high temperatures and voltages. Consequently Silicon Carbide is a key component in the manufacture of equipment such as ship engines or weapons.","factoryName":"Silicon Carbide Mill","icon":"ware_siliconcarbide","volume":20,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":1202,"max":1627,"avg":1414},"group":{"id":"hightech","name":"High Tech Goods","factoryName":"High Tech Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_hightech","tier":3},"production":[{"time":300,"amount":48,"method":"default","name":"Terran","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":200},{"ware":"metallicmicrolattice","amount":2},{"ware":"methane","amount":400},{"ware":"silicon","amount":300}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.2}]},{"time":300,"amount":60,"method":"recycling","name":"Recycling","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":4000},{"ware":"scrapmetal","amount":250}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.2}]}]}
