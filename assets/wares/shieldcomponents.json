{"id":"shieldcomponents","version":0,"name":"Shield Components","description":"From generators to coils that maintain energy over time, shield components are a wide arrange of technologies that provide everything necessary to build a variety of shields. Completely modular, each part can be used in each shield, which has led to a wide variety of new-generation shields being produced in recent years. As with all ship equipment, shields are built on-demand, and so shield components are produced in factories and shipped straight to shipyards and equipment docks where they can be more freely used for construction and repair.","factoryName":"Shield Component Factory","icon":"ware_shieldcomponents","volume":10,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":113,"max":264,"avg":188},"group":{"id":"shiptech","name":"Ship Technology","factoryName":"Ship Technology Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_shiptech","tier":4},"production":[{"time":1200,"amount":193,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":70},{"ware":"plasmaconductors","amount":20},{"ware":"quantumtubes","amount":20}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.43}]}]}
