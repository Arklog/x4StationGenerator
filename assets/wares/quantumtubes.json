Though the outer wiring itself it easy to make and understand, the internal structure and what the wiring actually carries must be constructed only by those with countless hours of study and examination under their belts; otherwise risking catastrophic failures that can lead to entire shutdowns of the equipment in which they are used.","factoryName":"Quantum Tube Factory","icon":"ware_quantumtubes","volume":22,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":225,"max":375,"avg":300},"group":{"id":"hightech","name":"High Tech Goods","factoryName":"High Tech Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_hightech","tier":3},"production":[{"time":720,"amount":94,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":40},{"ware":"graphene","amount":116},{"ware":"superfluidcoolant","amount":30}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.53}]}]}
