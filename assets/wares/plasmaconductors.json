{"id":"plasmaconductors","version":0,"name":"Plasma Conductors","description":"These conductors are designed to allow the flow of plasma through a component at the greatest possible efficiency. Though made relatively cheap to produce through years of research and development, plasma conductors remain highly complex pieces of technology. They are used primarily in the construction of weapon and shield components.","factoryName":"Plasma Conductor Factory","icon":"ware_plasmaconductors","volume":32,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":769,"max":1282,"avg":1026},"group":{"id":"hightech","name":"High Tech Goods","factoryName":"High Tech Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_hightech","tier":3},"production":[{"time":900,"amount":44,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":60},{"ware":"graphene","amount":96},{"ware":"superfluidcoolant","amount":140}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.43}]}]}
