{"id":"teladianium","version":0,"name":"Teladianium","description":"Teladianium is a hard, tough material used by the Teladi for station and, more commonly, ship construction. A lighter compound than the refined metals used in other races' vessels, Teladianium is traditionally made from chemically treated Teladian mud. However, as the necessary chemicals are rarely found in space, and expensive to produce, the Teladi often replace them with the raw minerals found in asteroids.","factoryName":"Teladianium Foundry","icon":"ware_teladianium","volume":16,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":121,"max":283,"avg":202},"group":{"id":"refined","name":"Refined Goods","factoryName":"Refined Goods Complex","icon":"be_upgrade_refined","tier":2},"production":[{"time":120,"amount":70,"method":"default","name":"Teladi","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":45},{"ware":"ore","amount":280}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.43}]}]}
