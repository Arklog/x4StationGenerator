{"id":"plankton","version":1,"name":"Plankton","description":"Boron plankton is found as a scum-like layer that floats on the surface of the chemical swamps on the Planet Nishala. It forms naturally where certain chemicals, that are found in the swamp, mix with the ammonia-based atmosphere.nnThis scum is collected, and then treated with additives and other Boron minerals, to produce a wide range of different, nutritious spices. Since the Boron seas are now completely protected from any industrial usage, Plankton is mainly produced in space, aboard huge Plankton Farms that can be found everywhere in the Queendom of Boron.","factoryName":"Plankton Farm","icon":"ware_plankton","volume":1,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":11,"max":25,"avg":18},"group":{"id":"agricultural","name":"Agricultural Goods","factoryName":"Agricultural Goods Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_agricultural","tier":5},"production":[{"time":400,"amount":275,"method":"default","name":"Boron","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":20},{"ware":"water","amount":50}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.4}]}]}
