{"id":"engineparts","version":0,"name":"Engine Parts","description":"Comprised of a number of different components that make up ship engines, engine parts are delivered straight to the end customer, most commonly shipyards and equipment docks, who then use them themselves to produce or repair engines. While naturally engine parts are a very necessary resource across the entire Jump Gate network, the ability to produce and repair engines on demand, instead of requiring an entirely separate production step for each, has greatly streamlined the universal economy.","factoryName":"Engine Part Factory","icon":"ware_engineparts","volume":15,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":128,"max":237,"avg":182},"group":{"id":"hightech","name":"High Tech Goods","factoryName":"High Tech Factory","icon":"be_upgrade_hightech","tier":3},"production":[{"time":900,"amount":208,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"antimattercells","amount":80},{"ware":"energycells","amount":60},{"ware":"refinedmetals","amount":96}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.47}]},{"time":900,"amount":208,"method":"teladi","name":"Teladi","wares":[{"ware":"antimattercells","amount":80},{"ware":"energycells","amount":60},{"ware":"teladianium","amount":70}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.47}]}]}
