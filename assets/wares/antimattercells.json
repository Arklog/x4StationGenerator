{"id":"antimattercells","version":0,"name":"Antimatter Cells","description":"Highly advanced magnetic storage devices that carry antimatter. Due to the effect of Hawking radiation and their being self-powered, antimatter cells cannot store antimatter indefinitely. They are produced and filled using refined hydrogen and primarily used in the production of engine parts, and also can be miniaturised to be used in claytronics.","factoryName":"Antimatter Cell Factory","icon":"ware_antimattercells","volume":18,"transport":"Container","price":{"min":121,"max":282,"avg":202},"group":{"id":"refined","name":"Refined Goods","factoryName":"Refined Goods Complex","icon":"be_upgrade_refined","tier":2},"production":[{"time":120,"amount":99,"method":"default","name":"Universal","wares":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":100},{"ware":"hydrogen","amount":320}],"effects":[{"type":"work","product":0.35}]}]}
